# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to LeetCode problems. The purpose of this repository is to document my progress and showcase my problem-solving skills. I mainly focus on solving easy problems that are part of the Grind 75 Questions plan.

## What is LeetCode?

[LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) is an online platform that provides a collection of coding challenges. It offers a wide range of algorithmic problems to help developers enhance their problem-solving skills and prepare for technical interviews. LeetCode problems are categorized by difficulty level, ranging from easy to hard.

The platform features a vast array of coding problems that cover various domains such as arrays, strings, linked lists, trees, graphs, dynamic programming, and more. Each problem presents a unique challenge that requires you to apply different algorithms and data structures to come up with an efficient solution.

## Grind 75 Questions Plan

The Grind 75 Questions plan is a popular study approach followed by many developers to prepare for technical interviews. It is designed to cover a comprehensive set of frequently asked coding problems that appear in interviews at top tech companies. The plan focuses on solving 75 carefully selected questions, divided into different categories and difficulty levels.

In this repository, I am primarily focusing on solving the easy problems from the Grind 75 Questions plan. By tackling these problems, I aim to strengthen my foundational knowledge of algorithms and data structures, improve my problem-solving abilities, and gain confidence in solving coding challenges.

## Structure of the Repository

The repository contains a list of Python files, each representing a specific LeetCode problem. The file names are derived from the names of the problems themselves. Each Python file contains my solution to the respective problem.

Please feel free to explore the repository, review the solutions, and provide feedback. All solutions in this repository are implemented in Python 3.

## Disclaimer

The solutions provided in this repository are my own work and may not be the most optimal or the only possible solutions to the problems. They reflect my understanding at the time of implementation. I encourage you to explore different approaches and optimize the solutions further.

Please note that LeetCode encourages users to learn from others but does not support the submission of any code that violates academic integrity policies or encourages cheating.

**Happy coding!**
